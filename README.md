# This is my implementation of the Goldilocks challenge

The challenge is found at https://qa-community.co.uk/~/_/learning/java-beginner/java--peer-programming

The challenge consisted in figuring out which chairs goldilocks could sit on based on her weight, porridge temperature tolerance and luminosity tolerance

For fun, I have made the program create seats at the table with random values each time, and Goldilocks will also have a different weight/temp/light tolerance each time which will be given from user input
